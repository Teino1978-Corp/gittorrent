#summary A few lines on the history and status of the protocol.
#labels Draft

The idea of a peer-to-peer protocol for distributing git repositories was first discussed on the #git IRC channel, where from the name given to this protocol proposal also comes. Given git's use of SHA1 for content-addressing and data integrity verification, something it shared with BitTorrent, the name "!GitTorrent" seems like a natural attribute and testament  to the strong foundation on which the protocol proposal is built.

The status of the protocol is that to this date it is still pretty much vaporware. Nothing has been proven yet: not the concept, not the nice intensions, or even if there is a need for this protocol. Look below for a list of initial work towards an implementation.
