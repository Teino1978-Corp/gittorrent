#summary A few lines on the history and status of the protocol.
#labels Draft

The idea of a peer-to-peer protocol for distributing git repositories was first discussed on the #git IRC channel. The name, "GitTorrent," can best be attributed to the similarities between git and BitTorrent, such as the use of SHA1 for content-addressing and verification name rhyming with _bit_. One such similarit 

Given git's use of SHA1 for content-addressing, something it shared with BitTorrent, the name "GitTorrent"

It is to this date still pretty much vaporware. Nothing has been proven yet: not the concept, not the nice intensions, or even if there is a need for this protocol.
