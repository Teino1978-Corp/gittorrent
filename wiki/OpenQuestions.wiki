== Are peer IDs needed? ==

In BitTorrent, the peer ID is generated by the peer itself. Consequently:

 * It is impossible to guarantee uniqueness (although the ID space is huge: 20 bytes).
 * Any peer can have multiple "personalities," and may even impersonate other peers in the swarm.

To a degree, some of these weaknesses (mainly uniqueness) can be enforced when centralized elements, such as trackers, are in used. Some trackers even "verifies" the peer credentials (peer ID, IP address, and port number) by trying to connect to the peer. However, multiple trackers can exist for the same swarm making it harder. Furthermore, decentralized tracking opens up other issues. The peer ID should therefore mostly be seen as a convinience: an easy way for the tracker to tell peers apart, and a method to ensure a small amount of accountability.

It is clear that at both the tracker and peer need some way to tell peers apart. From the compact tracker response format, though, peer IDs are not included to safe bandwidth. The question is whether the IP address and the port number provides enough information.
