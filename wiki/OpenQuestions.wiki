#summary Questions that needs further investigation

This page list some open questions; questions that should be studied and if deemed worthwhile added to LessonsLearned.

== Are peer IDs needed? ==

In BitTorrent, the peer ID is generated by the peer itself. Consequently:

 * It is impossible to guarantee uniqueness (although the ID space is huge: 20 bytes).
 * Any peer can have multiple "personalities," and may even impersonate other peers in the swarm.

To a degree, some of these problems (mainly uniqueness) can be avoided when centralized elements, such as trackers, are in use. Some trackers even "verifies" the peer credentials (peer ID, IP address, and port number) by trying to connect to the peer. However, multiple trackers can exist for the same swarm making it harder. Furthermore, decentralized tracking opens up other issues. The peer ID should therefore mostly be seen as a convinience: an easy way for the tracker to tell peers apart, and a method to ensure a small amount of accountability.

It is clear that both the tracker and peer need some way to tell peers apart. From the compact tracker response format, though, peer IDs are not included to safe bandwidth. The question is whether the IP address and the port number provides enough information.

== Are open source downloaders more altruistic? ==

Basically the (somewhat tongue in cheek) question is, whether anything can be said about the possible participants in a GitTorrent swarm, e.g. in terms of their willingness to contribute bandwidth? Furthermore, should any such assumption affect choices in the protocol? The obvious answer is of course *no!* but it might still be relevant to keep it in mind when giving guidelines for things like download strategy.
