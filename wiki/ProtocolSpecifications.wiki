#summary An overview of the different protocol specifications.
#labels Draft

To date, two different protocol specification have been proposed.

== Initial Protocol Draft ==

The initial RFC draft was the result of a [http://gittorrent.googlecode.com/files/Fonseca-2006.pdf project] done at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen ([http://www.diku.dk DIKU]) in 2006.

The protocol proposed in the initial RFC draft tried to reuse as much as possible from git's existing protocols in the exchange of the repository database. The result was a protocol that basically worked somewhat similar to git's "dumb" HTTP fetcher, which uses index files to discover which pack files contain interesting objects.

== Serialized Protocol Draft ==

TODO: Write about the [http://gittorrent.utsl.gen.nz/rfc.html extended RFC] by Sam Vilain, which introduces the concept of the _commit reel_.
