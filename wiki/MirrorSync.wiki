#summary Protocol design of the Mirror Sync Protocol

= Introduction =

This protocol was designed to be a stripped-down version of the GitTorrent protocol, instead of basing its core design on the binary BitTorrent protocol it is designed to fit cleanly into git.  Some of the core concepts - in particular, the design for dividing pushed and pulled packs into roughly equal sections - will be carried over.  But it will look very different to BitTorrent by the end of this.

= Key Mirror Sync Protocol Messages =

The entire Torrent process was broken down into these three parts.  In git development fashion each of which are to be evaluated and implemented independently and each one incrementally adds benefits.

* Mirror List - "get me a list of current mirrors, and tell me the latest 'ref'"

* Mirror Notify - "FYI, I'm mirroring repository X at location Y.  HAND!"

* Mirror Sync - "Oh hai, can you hand me a slice of git pack?  And want any of mine?"
