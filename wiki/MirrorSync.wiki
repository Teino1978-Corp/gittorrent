#summary Protocol design of the Mirror Sync Protocol

= Introduction =

This protocol was designed to be a stripped-down version of the GitTorrent protocol, instead of basing its core design on the binary BitTorrent protocol it is designed to fit cleanly into git.  Some of the core concepts - in particular, the design for dividing pushed and pulled packs into roughly equal sections - will be carried over.  But it will look very different to BitTorrent by the end of this.
